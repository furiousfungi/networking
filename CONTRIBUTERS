Introduction

This repository is maintained and owned by [furiousfungi]. Ownership here is not only a legal designation but also a statement of responsibility, stewardship, and commitment to the software, its users, and its contributors. Being an owner means upholding the values of transparency, integrity, and collaboration.

The purpose of this document is to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the owners, set expectations for contributors, and foster a healthy, respectful community around this code.

Philosophy of Ownership

Ownership is not just about control. It is about care, custodianship, and community engagement. Owners have the responsibility to:

Maintain Quality: Ensure that the repository remains functional, reliable, and secure. Owners review changes, approve pull requests, and enforce coding standards.

Encourage Collaboration: Facilitate a welcoming environment for contributors of all levels. Owners are mentors and guides, helping others navigate the project.

Preserve History: Respect the contributions of past maintainers. Every commit, issue, and discussion contributes to the story of this software.

Act Responsibly: Protect users and contributors from misuse or harm. Owners consider the broader impact of code and decisions.

Responsibilities

The owners of this repository are tasked with:

Code Review: Ensuring all contributions meet the technical and ethical standards of the project.

Documentation: Maintaining clear, accurate, and up-to-date documentation for users and contributors.

Issue Management: Responding to issues and feedback in a timely, constructive, and professional manner.

Licensing Compliance: Upholding the terms of the repository’s license and ensuring all contributions comply.

Community Engagement: Encouraging discussions, resolving conflicts, and promoting collaboration in a respectful manner.

Expectations for Owners

Owners are expected to:

Lead by example, both in technical skills and behavior.

Act transparently and communicate major decisions openly.

Make unbiased decisions, prioritizing the project’s health over personal preferences.

Support contributors, providing guidance, mentorship, and constructive feedback.

Governance

Owners may add or remove collaborators with caution and transparency. Decisions impacting the project’s direction, license, or major dependencies should be discussed with co-owners and contributors whenever possible.

Ownership is not absolute; it is earned and maintained through active participation, ethical behavior, and technical contribution. Passive or harmful behavior may result in the reassignment of ownership.

Final Thoughts

Being an owner of a repository is a privilege. It is a role that combines technical stewardship with ethical responsibility. Owners act as guardians of both the code and the community that surrounds it. Through careful management, respectful collaboration, and adherence to principles, owners ensure that this repository thrives for all who use, learn from, and contribute to it.
